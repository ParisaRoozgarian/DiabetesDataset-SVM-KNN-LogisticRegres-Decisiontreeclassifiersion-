# DiabetesDataset-SVM-KNN-LogisticRegres-Decisiontreeclassifiersion
The dataset used is, the dataset of information related to diabetic patients of a hospital. label is this data,
Outcome, which takes two values of 0 and 1, and indicates whether or not the patient has the disease.
It is diabetes. We divide this dataset into two parts, Train and Test.Using 4 methods, we design models based on dataset data :
- SVM
- KNN
- Logistic Regression 
- Decision Tree


To predict whether or not a patient will have diabetes with 4 methods. Then using evaluation methods module (f1_score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy) We evaluated each one and try to get the best possible result by changing the parameters 
Features of this dataset :
1. Pregnancies
2. Glucose 
3. Blood Pressure
4. Skin Thickness
5. Insulin
6. BMI 
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function 
8. Age

# SVM
Explanation of the SVM model:
SVM, or support vector machine, is a classifier or boundary that determines the best classification and separation between data by the criterion of placing support vectors.

Its purpose is to find the best border among the data in such a way that it has the greatest possible distance from all categories.
To use SVM in Python, we use the Python machine learning library named scikit-learn .
All kernels and mapping functions are prepared. The three functions NuSVC, LinearSVC, SVC are responsible for the main task of classification.
In the SVM code, we import the SVC class from the sklearn library and then create a new object and We store it inside the clf variable. We change the kernel parameter from its default value of 'rbf' to the value of 'linear'.Because it is more accurate. We put size_train=0.4 and size_test=0.2.
(kernel='rbf' â†’ kernel='linear')
In this class, we help to improve the evaluation result by changing the kernel parameter
