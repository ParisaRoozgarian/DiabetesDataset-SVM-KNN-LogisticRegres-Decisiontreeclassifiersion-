# DiabetesDataset-SVM-KNN-LogisticRegres-Decisiontreeclassifiersion
The dataset used is, the dataset of information related to diabetic patients of a hospital. label is this data,
Outcome, which takes two values of 0 and 1, and indicates whether or not the patient has the disease.
It is diabetes. We divide this dataset into two parts, Train and Test.Using 4 methods, we design models based on dataset data :
- SVM
- KNN
- Logistic Regression 
- Decision Tree.
to predict whether or not a patient will have diabetes with 4 methods. Then using evaluation methods module (f1_score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy) We evaluated each one and try to get the best possible result by changing the parameters 
Features of this dataset :
1. Pregnancies
2. Glucose 
3. Blood Pressure
4. Skin Thickness
5. Insulin
6. BMI 
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function 
8. Age
