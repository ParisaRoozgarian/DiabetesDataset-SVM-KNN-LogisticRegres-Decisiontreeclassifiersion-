# DiabetesDataset-SVM-KNN-LogisticRegres-Decisiontreeclassifiersion
The dataset used is, the dataset of information related to diabetic patients of a hospital. label is this data,
Outcome, which takes two values of 0 and 1, and indicates whether or not the patient has the disease.
It is diabetes. We divide this dataset into two parts, Train and Test.Using 4 methods, we design models based on dataset data:
-SVM
-KNN
-Logistic Regression 
-Decision Tree.
  -to predict whether or not a patient will have diabetes with 4 methods. Then using evaluation methods module (f1_score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy) We evaluated each one and try to get the best possible result by changing the parameters
